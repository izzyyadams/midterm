			<p>I was raised by two immigrant parents who were busy ensuring that my sister and I had food on the table, went to school, and stayed safe. They didn't have the tools to explain to us about safe sex and birth control and sexual health. But my sister and I knew that we had to keep ourselves safe, so we turned to Planned Parenthood for education. I knew I could get correct information from Planned Parenthood, and then I shared that information with my friends.<br><br>

	        A lot of parents and adults believe that keeping information about sexual health from teens is protecting them, but it's actually hurting them. We need to give teens information because that whether some folks like it or not, teens have sex and it's so important that they know how to protect themselves and get access to sexual health services.<br><br>

			Planned Parenthood has really cracked the code with reaching out to young people. When a young person talks to his or her peers and provides them with information that could save their lives, it builds trust and creates a safety net. It creates a culture where young people feel empowered, and most importantly, a culture where young people are aware of their options and have the ability to make their own decisions. I saw this happen first-hand in high school through my time as a peer sexual health educator with Planned Parenthood. I truly believe that Planned Parenthood does a phenomenal job of making sure that young people are equipped with information that will protect them for the rest of their lives.<br><br>

			Once I got to college, I began to transition from education work with Planned Parenthood into advocacy work. I had the opportunity of being on a council called Youth Rising. We focused primarily on underrepresented communities within our own hometowns. Serving on this council provided me with tools to create real change and provide information and access to reproductive healthcare to women, folks of color and young people. It reminded me the importance of grassroots social change.<br><br>

			I choose Planned Parenthood as my sexual and reproductive health provider because it's a nonjudgmental space. It is filled with doctors and staff members who really care.</p>
