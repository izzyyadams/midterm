			<p>When I was a teenager, I experienced unbearable menstrual pain. I read a magazine article about endometriosis and realized that I had every single symptom on the checklist. Endometriosis is a common health condition affecting about one in 10 women of reproductive age â€” more than five million American women.<br><br>

			My health care provider said I was too young to have endometriosis, and he told me that what I was experiencing was normal. But I knew something was seriously wrong.<br><br>

			When I was 18, I decided to visit a Planned Parenthood health center, and my provider there confirmed that indeed I was suffering from endometriosis. It was the first time I was taken seriously. The provider was really concerned about my welfare and how I was doing and that just made me feel great. It made all the difference in the world.<br><br>

			The lesions were removed, and Planned Parenthood provided me with Depo-Provera to manage my condition. No copay birth control is an essential tool helping women like me with endometriosis who otherwise would have to live with chronic pain.<br><br>

			But endometriosis sometimes can affect fertility, and it was unclear if I would be able to have children.<br><br>

			Today I am a 37-year-old mother of an adorable little girl. Motherhood has been the singularly most amazing thing in my life. My daughter is truly a gift, and I really have Planned Parenthood to thank for her.</p>
